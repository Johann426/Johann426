Consider burning hydrogen gas

$$
2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O + energy
$$

where ΔG°' (the standard free energy change at pH 7.0) = -474.3 kJ ˣ mol−1. The enthalpy of this reaction (ΔH°') is -571.66 kJ ˣ mol−1 (heat is given out) and the entropy (ΔS°') is -326.8 J K−1 (fewer molecules produced, therefore more order and less entropy). ΔG°' = ΔH°' - TΔS°' = -571.66 + 0.3268 ˣ 298 = -474.3 kJ ˣ mol−1.

# Water oxidation catalysis

Water oxidation catalysis (WOC) is the acceleration (catalysis) of the conversion of water into oxygen and protons:

$$
2H_2O \rightarrow 4H^+ + 4e^− + O_2
$$

Many catalysts are effective, both homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts. The oxygen evolving complex in photosynthesis is the premier example. There is no interest in generating oxygen by water oxidation since oxygen is readily obtained from air. Instead, interest in water oxidation is motivated by its relevance to water splitting, which would provide "solar hydrogen," i.e. water oxidation would generate the electrons and protons for the production of hydrogen.
