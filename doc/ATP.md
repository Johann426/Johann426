## ATP

Adenosine 5′-triphosphate, abbreviated ATP and usually expressed without the 5′-, is an important energy carrier for biochemical reactions in living cells.

ATP is comprised of the molecule adenosine bound to three phosphate groups. The two bonds between the phosphates are equal high-energy bonds (phosphoanhydride bonds) that, when broken, release sufficient energy to power a variety of cellular reactions and processes. The bond between the beta and gamma phosphate is considered "high-energy" because when the bond breaks, the products [adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and one inorganic phosphate group (Pi)] have a lower free energy than the reactants (ATP and a water molecule).

$$ ATP + H_20 \rightarrow ADP + P_i + energy $$

Like most chemical reactions, the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP is reversible. The reverse reaction combines ADP + Pi to regenerate ATP from ADP. Since ATP hydrolysis releases energy, ATP synthesis must require an input of free energy.

Data from R. A. Alberty, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 353, 116 (1998).

 Standard Gibbs energy of one mole of ATP into ADP & Pi is −7.3 kcal/mole (−30.5 kJ/mol). However, this is only true under standard conditions, and the ∆G for the hydrolysis of one mole of ATP in a living cell is almost double the value at standard conditions: 14 kcal/mol (−57 kJ/mol).
