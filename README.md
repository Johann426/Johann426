## Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the primary energy-storing process by plants. The process convert light energy into chemical energy through a series of biochemical reactions inside chloroplast.

A general equation for photosynthesis, as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel, can be written as:<br>

$$
\underbrace{ 6CO_2 }_\text{ carbon dioxide } \quad + \quad \underbrace{ 12H_2A }_\text{ hydrogen donor } \quad
\xrightarrow[\text{ (light energy) }]{ photons } \quad
\underbrace{ C_6H_{12}O_6 }_\text{ carbohydrate } \quad + \quad \underbrace{ 6H_2O }_\text{ water } \quad + \quad 12A
$$

H<sub>2</sub>A is generally H<sub>2</sub>O, however it can be any inorganic hydrogen donor such as H<sub>2</sub>S (in this case, A is sulfur). The hydrogen freed by splitting the donor is used to produce the carbohydrate.

Since water is used as the hydrogen donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is written as:

$$
\underbrace{ 6CO_2 }_\text{ carbon dioxide } \quad + \quad \underbrace{ 12H_2O }_\text{ water } \quad
\xrightarrow[\text{ (light energy) }]{ photons } \quad
\underbrace{ C_6H_{12}O_6 }_\text{ glucose } \quad + \quad \underbrace{ 6H_2O }_\text{ water } \quad + \quad 6O_2
$$

By glancing at the equation, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen. Water is not only a reactant but a product of the reactions.

The standard Gibbs free energy for the synthesis of glucose is 2,870 kJ/mol, whereas a mole of photons of 600-nm wavelength has an energy content of [209](./doc/EnergyPhoton.md) kJ/mol. The efficiency of photosynthesis can be estimated from the energy input of 8 moles of photons which lead to nominal efficiency of 30 % (Biochemistry by Stryer, Lubert). In actually, however, a maximum overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6% of total solar radiation due to reflection, optimal radiation level, valid wavelength range) "Renewable biological systems for unsustainable energy production (1997)".

Photosynthesis occurs in [chloroplasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast) typically 5 μm long.

The process of photosynthesis is composed of two stages: the light-dependent reactions and enzymatic reactions which are also called the *Calvin cycle*.

### Stage 1. Light-dependent reactions

In the light-dependent reactions, thylakoid membranes forming stacks of disks referred to as grana absorbs energy of light, liberate oxygen from water, and transport electron to make the energy-storage molecules, [ATP](./doc/ATP.md), and hydrogen carrier, [NADPH](./doc/NADPH.md).

Chlorophylls, which are very effective photoreceptors in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, are composed of magnesium ion bonds with organic pigments at the center of the structure.

 Chlorophylls absorb light most strongly in the blue portion of the spectrum as well as the red portion. A measure of a its ability to absorb light, peak molar extinction coefficient (ɛ), is greater than 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> for chlorophyll a, among the highest observed for organic compounds.

An electron is excited by the energy from the light, and then it can be transferred to an acceptor through an electron transport chain which is a series of protein complexes that contain heme (hemoproteins) and other molecules.

proteins containing a heme, with a central Fe atom at its core, as a cofactor. 



The two currently accepted photosystem units are photosystem I and photosystem II, which have their own distinct reaction centres, named P700 and P680, respectively. These centres are named after the wavelength (in nanometers) of their red-peak absorption maximum.





### Stage 2. Calvin cycle

Temperature-sensitive enaymatic reactions occur in stroma. The colorless stroma contains water-soluble enzymes, captures carbon dioxide, and uses the energy of ATP and NADPH.

The net reaction of the Calvin cycle:
$$
6CO_2 + 18ATP + 12NADPH + 12H_2O 
\rightarrow
C_6H_{12}O_6 + 18ADP + 18P_i + 12NADP^+ + 6H^+
$$










### Stroma
Stroma is the colorless fluid surrounding the grana within the chloroplast.
The series of biochemical redox reactions which take place in the stroma are collectively called the Calvin cycle or light-independent reactions. There are three phases: carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration.
