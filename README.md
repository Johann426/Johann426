# Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the primary energy-storing process by plants. The process convert light energy into chemical energy through a series of biochemical reactions by plants, algae and cyanobacteria.

A general equation for photosynthesis, as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel, can be written as:<br>

$$
\underbrace{ 6CO_2 }_\text{ carbon dioxide } + \underbrace{ 12H_2A }_\text{ hydrogen donor }
\xrightarrow[\text{ (light energy) }]{ photons } \
\underbrace{ C_6H_{12}O_6 }_\text{ carbohydrate } \ + \ \underbrace{ 6H_2O }_\text{ water } \ + \ 12A
$$

H<sub>2</sub>A is generally H<sub>2</sub>O, however it can be any inorganic hydrogen donor such as H<sub>2</sub>S (in this case, A is sulfur). The hydrogen freed by splitting the donor is used to produce the carbohydrate.

Since water is used as the hydrogen donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is written as:

$$
\underbrace{ 6CO_2 }_\text{ carbon dioxide } + \quad \underbrace{ 12H_2O }_\text{ water } \
\xrightarrow[\text{ (light energy) }]{ photons } \
\underbrace{ C_6H_{12}O_6 }_\text{ glucose } \ + \ \underbrace{ 6H_2O }_\text{ water } \ + \ 6O_2
$$

where C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> is glucose (which is subsequently transformed into other sugars, starches, and cellulose).

By glancing at the equation, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose and oxygen, and water is not only a reactant but a product of the reactions.

The standard Gibbs free energy for this synthesis of glucose is 2,870 kJ/mol, whereas a mole of photons of 600-nm wavelength has an energy content of [209](./doc/EnergyPhoton.md) kJ/mol. The efficiency of photosynthesis can be estimated from the energy input of 8 moles of photons which lead to nominal efficiency of 30 % (Biochemistry by Stryer, Lubert). In actually, however, an overall photosynthetic efficiency of 3 to 6 % of total solar radiation is considered as the maximum value due to reflection of light, optimal radiation level, valid wavelength range (Renewable biological systems for unsustainable energy production, 1997).

In plants and algae, photosynthesis occurs in [chloroplasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast) typically 3 to 10 μm in diameter.

Chloroplasts have three membrane systems: the outer membrane, the inner membrane, and the thylakoid system. Inside the outer and inner membranes, a colorless fluid referred to as stroma makes up much of a chloroplast's volume, and in which many proteins and the thylakoids forming stacks of disks referred to as grana can be found. The thylakoid membrane and the inner membrane are impermeable to most molecules and ions. The outer membrane is highly permeable to small molecules and ions.

The process of photosynthesis is composed of two stages: the light-dependent reactions and enzymatic reactions which are also called the *Calvin cycle*.

## Stage 1. Light-dependent reactions

The equation for the light-dependent reactions in green plants is:

$$
2H_2O + 2 NADP^+ + 3 ADP + 3P_i
\xrightarrow[\text{ (light energy) }]{ photons } \
O_2 + 2H^+ + 2NADPH + 3ATP
$$

In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll pigments embedded in thylakoid membranes absorbs energy of light. 

Chlorophylls, which are very effective photoreceptors, are composed of magnesium ion bonds with organic pigments at the center of the structure.

Chlorophylls absorb light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as the red portion. A measure of a its ability to absorb light, peak molar extinction coefficient (ɛ), is greater than 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> for chlorophyll a, among the highest found in organic compounds.

In thylakoid membraine of green plants, photosystem II, catalyzed by a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion, liberate oxygen as well as hydrogen ions from water. It transfer electron excited by light energy to acceptors through an electron transport chain referred to as Z-scheme.

Photosystem II (also called P680 as it absorbs up to 680 nm wavelengths) consists of protein complexes with numerous bound of chlorophyll. It receives excitation energy either by directly absorbing a photon or indirectly from other chlorophylls. By positively charged, P680+ is highly oxidant (also called as oxidizer or electron acceptor) extracts an electron from water molecules bound at the water-oxidizing complex (WOC), also called the manganese center. By exciting an electron to a higher energy level, P680* donates an electron to plastoquinone cycles between an oxidized form (Q) and a reduced form (QH2, plastoquinol).

The major difference between the bacterial system and
photosystem II is the source of the electrons that are used to
neutralize the positive charge formed on the special pair. P680+, a very strong oxidant, 



Photosystem I absorbing up to 700 nm wavelengths uses electrons excited to create [NADPH](./doc/NADPH.md).

The electrons travel from photosystem II to photosystem I through cytochrome bf. Cytochrome bf generates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane that drives the formation of [ATP](./doc/ATP.md).

### Stage 2. Calvin cycle

Temperature-sensitive enaymatic reactions occur in stroma. The colorless stroma contains water-soluble enzymes, captures carbon dioxide, and uses the energy of ATP and NADPH to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into sugar.

The net reaction of the Calvin cycle:
$$
6CO_2 + 18ATP + 12NADPH + 12H_2O 
\rightarrow
C_6H_{12}O_6 + 18ADP + 18P_i + 12NADP^+ + 6H^+
$$










### Stroma
Stroma is the colorless fluid surrounding the grana within the chloroplast.
The series of biochemical redox reactions which take place in the stroma are collectively called the Calvin cycle or light-independent reactions. There are three phases: carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration.
